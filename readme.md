## Introduction

### Giude to the Scrum Body of Knowledge

### Definitive Giude for Scrum and rules for the game

Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex projects

**`What is the Scrum body of knowledge`**
It is compilation of the latest methods and best practices employed by its practitioners and experts futhermore, it provides guildlines for the successful implementaion of Scrum, it is the most popular agile project management and Project development framework. It also comprehensive frameworks that includes the priciples, aspects and processes of Scrum framework.

**`The Scrum frameword is widely used across`**

<!-- - [x] Portfolios
- [ ] unchecked -->

- Portfolios
- Programs
- Projects in any industry
- Products
- Services
- Any other deliverables to be developed
- Projects of any size or complexity

According to the Scrum body of Knowloedge, the term product may refer to product service and other deliverable

**`Practicality of Scrum as a framework is that it can be applied effectively to any project in any inductry whether they are small projects with 6-person teams or large complex projects with up to several hundred team members`**

### Overview of a Scrum

A Scrum project involves a `collaborative` effort to create a new product, service, or other result as defined in the Project `Vision Statement`

Projects are impacted by

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Resources
- Organization Capabilites
- Other Limitations that make them difficult to Plan, Execute, Manage and Utimately succeed.  
  However Successful implementation of the result of a finished project provides significant `business benefits` to an organisation.

  It is therefore important for organization to select and practice an appropriate Project Management Framework

## **Scrum**

- [x] Popular Agile methodology
- [x] Adaptive, iterative, fast, flexible and effective
- [x] Ensure transparency in communication
- [x] Creates collective accountability and progress
- [x] Scrum framework supports all kinds of projects

## **Why is Scrum better than other Project Management Techniques**

ensure `Cross-Functional, Self-Organised and use Sprints`

Think of Sprint as short times spans in which a certain amount of work must be done

Project Business Case- Stackholder meeting during which the Project Vision Statement is created, the product owner then develop the prioritize Product Backlog which contains a prioritized of `business and project requirements written in the form of User Stories`. Each sprint begins with a spring planning meeting during which high priority User Stories are considered for `inclusion` in the Sprint. A Sprint generally lasts between `one and six weeks` and involves the scrum team working to create potential shipable deliverables or products incremement. During this Sprint, short, highly focused `Daily StandUp` Meetings are conducted when team memebers discussed daily programs. Toward the end of this Sprint, a Sprint Review Meeting is held during which the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders are provided a demostration of the `Deliverables.` The Product Owner accpets the Deliverables only if they meet the `Predefined Acceptance Criteria` .

The Sprint cycle into the **Retrospect Sprint Meeting** when the team discusses ways to processes and performance as the move forward in the subsequent Sprint.

### History of Scrum

The framework had its inception in the 1980s. In the mid 80s, _Hirotaka Takeuchi_ and _Ikujiro Nonaka_ defined a flexible and all-inclusive product development strategy with the development team works as a unit to reach a common goal.

#### Rugby Approach

They described an `innovative` approach to product development that they called a holistic or "Rugby" approach. When a team tries to a distant as a unit, passing the ball back and forth. They based their approach on manufacturing `Case Studies` from different Industries.

_Hirotaka Takeuchi_ and _Ikujiro Nonaka_ proposed that Product Development should not be like a sequential relay race, but rather should be analogous to the game of Rugby. When the team work together passing balls back and forth as they move a unit down the field. The Rugby becomes Scrum where group of players form together to restart the game was introduced to this new article to describe the autos proposal that Product development should involve **Moving the scrum downfield**

Later _Ken Schwaber_ and _Jeff Sutherland_ elaborated on the Scrum concept and its applicability to Software Development in 1995 in Autin, Texas in a presentation in an Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA) conference held in 1995 in Austin, Texas

Since then, several Scrum practitoners, experts and authors have continued to refine the Scrum conceptualization and methodology.

### Why use Scrum?

- [x] Adaptivity - Empirical process control and iteratively delivery make projects adaptable and open to incorporating change when it occurs.
- [x] Customer Centric - Ensure a customer-oriented framework in a Scrum-controlled project.
- [x] Continous Delivery of Value - Delivery of value through the Ship Deliverables process as frequently as the customer requires.
- [x] Early Delivery of High value -- it is closely related business benefits of using Scrum - The Create Prioritized Product Backlog process ensures that the highest value requirements of the customers are satisfied first.
- [x] Continous Feedback - is provided through the Conduct daily standup and demostrate and Validate Sprint processes.
- [x] Transparency - Information emitters like a `Scrumboard` and Sprint `Burndown Chart` are shared, which leads to an open working environment.

Sprint Review Meetings demostrate potentially shippable products to stakeholders, keeping them full informed about the current status and progress of the project.

- [x] Continuous Improvement
      Deliverables are improved progressively Sprint by Sprint, through the Groom Prioritized Product Backlog Process.

- [x] Sustainable Pace
      People involved can work at a sustainable pace that they can, in theory, continue indefinitely.

- [x] Effienct Development Process - It is observed that time-boxing and minimizing non-essential work leads to higher efficiency levels.
- [x] Motivation - Conducting Daily Standup and Retrospect Sprint processes lead to greater levels of motivation among employees.

- [x] Faster Problem Resolution - Collaboration and colocation of cross-functional teams leads to faster problem solving.

- [x] Effective Deliverables - Prioritized Product Backlog process and regular reviews after creating deliverables ensures effective deliverables to the customer.

- [x] Collective Ownership - The Estimate User Stories process and Commit User Stories process allow team memebers to take ownership of the project.

- [x] High Velocity - Enables highly skilled cross-functional teams to achieve their full potential and high velocity.

- [x] Innovative Environment - Learning and adaptability lead to an innovative and creative work environment

### Purpose of SBOK

#### Why do we need SBOK Guide? and What is it based on?

More organisations are choosing
**Scrum over other project management models**

This suggests that Scrum principles and practices are having greater impact than traditional project management models.
SOBOK Guide was developed as a means to create necessary guide for Organizaiton and Project management practitioners who want to implement Scrum as well as those already doing so who want to make needed improvements to their processes. It is based on exprience drawn from numerous projects across variety of organisations and industries. The contributions of many Scrum experts and Project management practitioners have considered in the development of SBOK Guide.

#### Who uses SBOK Guide? And How it is valued?

The SBOK Guide is especially valuable to Scrum Teams members.

**Who are the Scrum Core Team members?**
Lets meet them one by one.

- [x] Product owners come first- They use SBOK Guide to fully understand Scrum Framework and particularly customer and stakeholder related concerns involving Business justification, Quality, Change and Risk aspects associated with Scrum projects
- [x] Scrum Masters are next group of people who uses SBOK Guide to learn their specific role and overseeing application from Scrum Framework to Scrum Projects
- [x] The Scrum Team members who use SBOK Guide to better understand Scrum processes and associated tools that may be used to create projects, product or service.

The SBOK Guide is valued in other aspects as well, it used as comprehensive guide for all Scrum practitioners working on Scrum projects in any organization or industry. It is a reference source for anyone interacting with Scrum Core Team including but not limited to **Portfolio Product Owner, Portfolio Scrum Master, Program Product Owner, Program Scrum Master, Scrum Guidance Body and Stakeholders such as sponsor, customer and users**. And it is a knowledge for any person who has no prior experience or knowledge of Scrum Framework but want to learn deatails about the subject.

### Framework of the SBOK Guide

3 key areas:

1. Principles
2. Aspects
3. Processes

## `Principles`

Total number of six principles given in SBOK Guide from the foundational Scrum
they are:

- [x] Process Control
- [x] Self-organization
- [x] Collaboration
- [x] Value-based prioritization
- [x] Time-boxing
- [x] Iterative development

## `Aspects`

There are 5 Scrum Aspects

- [x] Organization
- [x] Business Justification
- [x] Quality
- [x] Change
- [x] Risk

These aspects are important considerations to be included in all Scrum Projects

## `Processes`

There are 19 fundamental Processes and eight additional processes required for scaling Scrum to large projects and enterprise. The 19 fundamental processes are distributed across 5 phases. Which are:

- [x] Initiate
- [x] Plan and Estimate
- [x] Implement
- [x] Review and Retrospect
- [x] Release

Within the phases, you will find the detailed description of each process its input, tools and output.
