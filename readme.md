# Scrum

## Introduction

### Giude to the Scrum Body of Knowledge

### Definitive Giude for Scrum and rules for the game

Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex projects

**`What is the Scrum body of knowledge`**
It is compilation of the latest methods and best practices employed by its practitioners and experts futhermore, it provides guildlines for the successful implementaion of Scrum, it is the most popular agile project management and Project development framework. It also comprehensive frameworks that includes the priciples, aspects and processes of Scrum framework.

**`The Scrum framework is widely used across`**

<!-- - [x] Portfolios
- [ ] unchecked -->

- Portfolios
- Programs
- Projects in any industry
- Products
- Services
- Any other deliverables to be developed
- Projects of any size or complexity

According to the Scrum body of Knowloedge, the term product may refer to product service and other deliverable

**`Practicality of Scrum as a framework is that it can be applied effectively to any project in any industry whether they are small projects with 6-person teams or large complex projects with up to several hundred team members`**

### Overview of a Scrum

A Scrum project involves a `collaborative` effort to create a new product, service, or other result as defined in the Project `Vision Statement`

Projects are impacted by

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Resources
- Organization Capabilites
- Other Limitations that make them difficult to Plan, Execute, Manage and Utimately succeed.  
  However Successful implementation of the result of a finished project provides significant `business benefits` to an organisation.

  It is therefore important for organization to select and practice an appropriate Project Management Framework

## **Scrum**

- [x] Popular Agile methodology
- [x] Adaptive, iterative, fast, flexible and effective
- [x] Ensure transparency in communication
- [x] Creates collective accountability and progress
- [x] Scrum framework supports all kinds of projects

## **Why is Scrum better than other Project Management Techniques**

ensure `Cross-Functional, Self-Organised and use Sprints`

Think of Sprint as short times spans in which a certain amount of work must be done

![scrum-flow](/02-scrum-flow.JPG)

Project Business Case- Stackholder meeting during which the Project Vision Statement is created, the product owner then develop the prioritize Product Backlog which contains a prioritized of `business and project requirements written in the form of User Stories`. Each sprint begins with a spring planning meeting during which high priority User Stories are considered for `inclusion` in the Sprint. A Sprint generally lasts between `one and six weeks` and involves the scrum team working to create potential shipable deliverables or products incremement. During this Sprint, short, highly focused `Daily StandUp` Meetings are conducted when team memebers discussed daily programs. Toward the end of this Sprint, a Sprint Review Meeting is held during which the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders are provided a demostration of the `Deliverables.` The Product Owner accpets the Deliverables only if they meet the `Predefined Acceptance Criteria` .

The Sprint cycle into the **Retrospect Sprint Meeting** when the team discusses ways to processes and performance as the move forward in the subsequent Sprint.

### History of Scrum

The framework had its inception in the 1980s. In the mid 80s, _Hirotaka Takeuchi_ and _Ikujiro Nonaka_ defined a flexible and all-inclusive product development strategy with the development team works as a unit to reach a common goal.

#### Rugby Approach

They described an `innovative` approach to product development that they called a holistic or "Rugby" approach. When a team tries to a distant as a unit, passing the ball back and forth. They based their approach on manufacturing `Case Studies` from different Industries.

_Hirotaka Takeuchi_ and _Ikujiro Nonaka_ proposed that Product Development should not be like a sequential relay race, but rather should be analogous to the game of Rugby. When the team work together passing balls back and forth as they move a unit down the field. The Rugby becomes Scrum where group of players form together to restart the game was introduced to this new article to describe the autos proposal that Product development should involve **Moving the scrum downfield**

Later _Ken Schwaber_ and _Jeff Sutherland_ elaborated on the Scrum concept and its applicability to Software Development in 1995 in Autin, Texas in a presentation in an Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA) conference held in 1995 in Austin, Texas

Since then, several Scrum practitoners, experts and authors have continued to refine the Scrum conceptualization and methodology.

### Why use Scrum?

- [x] Adaptivity - Empirical process control and iteratively delivery make projects adaptable and open to incorporating change when it occurs.
- [x] Customer Centric - Ensure a customer-oriented framework in a Scrum-controlled project.
- [x] Continous Delivery of Value - Delivery of value through the Ship Deliverables process as frequently as the customer requires.
- [x] Early Delivery of High value -- it is closely related business benefits of using Scrum - The Create Prioritized Product Backlog process ensures that the highest value requirements of the customers are satisfied first.
- [x] Continous Feedback - is provided through the Conduct daily standup and demostrate and Validate Sprint processes.
- [x] Transparency - Information emitters like a `Scrumboard` and Sprint `Burndown Chart` are shared, which leads to an open working environment.

Sprint Review Meetings demostrate potentially shippable products to stakeholders, keeping them full informed about the current status and progress of the project.

- [x] Continuous Improvement
      Deliverables are improved progressively Sprint by Sprint, through the Groom Prioritized Product Backlog Process.

- [x] Sustainable Pace
      People involved can work at a sustainable pace that they can, in theory, continue indefinitely.

- [x] Effienct Development Process - It is observed that time-boxing and minimizing non-essential work leads to higher efficiency levels.
- [x] Motivation - Conducting Daily Standup and Retrospect Sprint processes lead to greater levels of motivation among employees.

- [x] Faster Problem Resolution - Collaboration and colocation of cross-functional teams leads to faster problem solving.

- [x] Effective Deliverables - Prioritized Product Backlog process and regular reviews after creating deliverables ensures effective deliverables to the customer.

- [x] Collective Ownership - The Estimate User Stories process and Commit User Stories process allow team memebers to take ownership of the project.

- [x] High Velocity - Enables highly skilled cross-functional teams to achieve their full potential and high velocity.

- [x] Innovative Environment - Learning and adaptability lead to an innovative and creative work environment

### Purpose of SBOK

#### Why do we need SBOK Guide? and What is it based on?

More organisations are choosing
**Scrum over other project management models**

This suggests that Scrum principles and practices are having greater impact than traditional project management models.
SOBOK Guide was developed as a means to create necessary guide for Organizaiton and Project management practitioners who want to implement Scrum as well as those already doing so who want to make needed improvements to their processes. It is based on exprience drawn from numerous projects across variety of organisations and industries. The contributions of many Scrum experts and Project management practitioners have considered in the development of SBOK Guide.

#### Who uses SBOK Guide? And How it is valued?

The SBOK Guide is especially valuable to Scrum Teams members.

**Who are the Scrum Core Team members?**
Lets meet them one by one.

- [x] Product owners come first- They use SBOK Guide to fully understand Scrum Framework and particularly customer and stakeholder related concerns involving Business justification, Quality, Change and Risk aspects associated with Scrum projects
- [x] Scrum Masters are next group of people who uses SBOK Guide to learn their specific role and overseeing application from Scrum Framework to Scrum Projects
- [x] The Scrum Team members who use SBOK Guide to better understand Scrum processes and associated tools that may be used to create projects, product or service.

The SBOK Guide is valued in other aspects as well, it used as comprehensive guide for all Scrum practitioners working on Scrum projects in any organization or industry. It is a reference source for anyone interacting with Scrum Core Team including but not limited to **Portfolio Product Owner, Portfolio Scrum Master, Program Product Owner, Program Scrum Master, Scrum Guidance Body and Stakeholders such as sponsor, customer and users**. And it is a knowledge for any person who has no prior experience or knowledge of Scrum Framework but want to learn deatails about the subject.

### Framework of the SBOK Guide

3 key areas:

1. Principles
2. Aspects
3. Processes

## `Principles`

Total number of six principles given in SBOK Guide from the foundational Scrum
they are:

- [x] Process Control
- [x] Self-organization
- [x] Collaboration
- [x] Value-based prioritization
- [x] Time-boxing
- [x] Iterative development

## `Aspects`

There are 5 Scrum Aspects

- [x] Organization
- [x] Business Justification
- [x] Quality
- [x] Change
- [x] Risk

These aspects are important considerations to be included in all Scrum Projects

## `Processes`

There are 19 fundamental Processes and eight additional processes required for scaling Scrum to large projects and enterprise. The 19 fundamental processes are distributed across 5 phases. Which are:

- [x] Initiate
- [x] Plan and Estimate
- [x] Implement
- [x] Review and Retrospect
- [x] Release

Within the phases, you will find the detailed description of each process its input, tools and output.

### How to use SBOK Guide

The SBOK guide is a reference and knowledge guide. It is used by experienced Scrum practitioners and other product and service developers as well as persion with no prior exprience or knowledge of Scrum or other project management Frameworks.

In the SBOK Guide, you will find contents are organised for easy reference by the three Scrum Core Team roles - Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team.

The content for eact Scrum core team role is identified in the Roles Guide section.

A roles guide provides direction regarding the relevance of each section in the chapter to the Scrum Core Team member.

## Scrum Principles

why is it so important?

Scrum principles are the core **guidelines** for applying the Scrum framework and should **mandatorily** be used in all Scrum Projects.

1. Empirical Process Control
   This principle emphasizes the core philosophy of Scrum based on the three main idea - Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation.

2. Self-Organisation: This focuses on today's workers who deliver significantly greater values when encouraged the self-organised rather than working under the command and control style of traditional project management.

3. Collaboration: focuses on the 3 core dimensions related to collaborative work i.e. Awareness, Aritculation and Appropriation. It also advocates project management as a shared value-creation process with teams working and interacting together to deliver the greatest value.

4. Value-based Prioritization: This principles highlight the focus of Scrum to deliver maximum business value. Begining only in the project and continuing throughout.

5. Time-boxing: This descibes how time is considered a **limiting contraint** in Scrum. Time-boxing is used to help effectively manage project planning and execution. Time-box element in Scrum includes Sprint, Daily Standup Meetings, Sprint Planning Meetings and Sprint Review Meetings.

6. Iterative development: This principle defines iterative development and emphasizes how to better manage **changes** and build **projects** that satisfy customer needs. It also dominates the product owner and organisation responsibilities related iterative development.

## Scrum Aspects

What are these Aspects?
The Scrum aspects must be addressed and managed throughout a Scrum Project

The 5 five Scrum Aspects will be:

1. Organization
2. Business justification
3. Quality
4. Change
5. Risk

### Understanding defined Roles and Responsibilities

This ensures the implementation of Scrum. Scrum roles follow two broad categories.

1. Core Roles
2. Non-core Roles

**Core Roles** are involved in producing the project's product or service. Individuals assigned Core roles are **fully committed** to the project. They ultimately responsible for the success of each project iteration and of project as a whole. Core roles assigned Product Owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team.

**Product Owner**

- Responsible for achieving maximum business value for project.
- Articulates customer requirements
- Maintains business justification for a project
- Represent the customers' voice.

**Scrum Master**

- **Ensures that the Scrum Team has an** appropriate environment conducive to complete the project successfully.
- Scrum Master guides, facilitates and teaches **Scrum practices** to everyone involved in a project.
- Clears impediments **for the team**
- Ensures that Scrum processes are being followed

**Scrum Team**

- **Responsible for understanding** Product Owner specified requirements and creating project deliverables

**Non-core Roles** The none core roles are optional and may include all team members who are interested in the project. No formal role in the project team, but may interface with the team. They may not be responsible for the success of the project. Who is involved in non-core roles? Stakeholder(s), Scrum Guidance Body and Vendors.

Let's meet them one by one

**Stakeholders** This is the collective terms that include Customers, Users and Sponsors and they frequently communicate with Scrum Core Team and influence the project throughout the project development. Most importantly, It is for the stake holders that project produces the collaborative benefits.

**Scrum Guidance Body** This is also referred to as the SGB. It is an optional role consisting a set of documents or group of experts typically involved with defining objectives related to the quality - Government regulation, Security and other key organisation parameters.
Guides the work carried out by the Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team.

**Vendors** They include externals individuals or internal organisation that provide products and services that are not withing the core competencies of the project organization

![Aspects](/03-Aspects.JPG)

### Business Justification:

It is important for an organization to perform business assessment before the start of the program. This helps the key decision makers to understand the business need for a change, new product or service.
The justification of moving forward with the project and its viability. Business justification and Scrum is based on the Value-driven delivery. One of the key characteristics of any project is the **uncertainty of results or outcomes** - It is impossible to guarantee Project's success and completion regardless of the size of complexity of the project. Considering the uncertainty of achieve a success, Scrum attempts to start delivering results as early in the project as possible. This early delivery of results and there by values, provides an opportunity for reinvestment and prove the worth of the project to interesed stakeholders. Furthermore, Scrums adapt the ability that allows the Project's obejectives and processes to change in case of business justification changes. **It important to note that the product owner primarily responsible for business justification**

### Quality:

In Scrum, quality is defined as the ability of the completed product or **deliverables** to meet the **Acceptance Criteria** and achieve the business value expected by the customer.

To ensure that the project meet the quality requirements, Scrum adopts an approach of continuous improvement whereby the teams learns from experience and stakeholder engagement to constantly keep the Prioritized Product Backlog

The prioritized Product Backlog is simply never complete until the closure of termination of the project. Moreover, any changes requirements reflect changes in the internal and external business environment

Scrum requires work to be completed in an incremental fashion through Sprints rather than waiting unto the end to produce delieverables, due to this, errors are fixed right away instead of being postponed till the end of the project. Moreover, important quality-related tasks for example development, testing and documentation are completed as part of the same Sprint by the same team. This ensures that quality is inherit in any deliverable created as part of a Sprint. Such deliverables from Scrum projects which are potentially shipable are also referred to as done. For example, if internal customers are not happy with a product delivered in terms of "quality", the issues can be listed in the Prioritized Product Backlog. This kind of issue will be addressed through ~~his friends~~. And the team will try to fix them and so the quality is not compromised.

Continuous improvement with repetitive testing optimizes the probability of achieving the expected quality levels in ~~his~~ Scrum's project.

Contact discussions between the Scrum Core Team and Stakeholders including customers and users. Ensures that the gap between customer expectations from the project and actual deliverables produced is constantly reduced. The scrum guide may also provides guidelines about quality which may be relevant to all scrum projects in an organization.

### Change:

Every project, regardless of its method or framework used, is exposed to change. It is imperative that project team members understand that the Scrum development processes are designed to embrace change. Organisations should try to maximize the benefits that arise from change and maximize any negative impacts.

A primary principle of Scrum is its acknowledges which are as follows

Stakeholders - Customers, users and sponsors may change their mind about what they want during the course of the project which sometimes means a _Requirements Churn_

It is not always feasible for stakeholders to define requirements during project initiation.

SCRUM project welcomes change by using short iterative sprints that incorporate customer feedback on each sprint deliverable. This enables customers to regularly interact with Scrum Team members and view deliverables as they are ready and even to change requirements if needed.

### Risk:

Risk is defined as an uncertain event or set of events that can affect the objectives of a project and may contribute to its success or failure.

Positive impact - Opportunities
Negative impact - Threats

For example: Considering a situation in which one of the key investors in a project backs off at a prime moment. This is a risk affecting the project in a negative way. However, if the project finds a better investor willing to invest in a bigger and a better way, it can be considered as an opportunity.

Managing risk must be done proactively. It is an iterative process that should begin at project initiation and continue throughout the project's lifecycle.

The process managing should followed standardized steps to ensure risks are:

Identified

Evaluated

and Proper course of action is determined upon and acted upon accordingly

Risks should be identified, assessed and responded to, based on two factors:

The probability of each risk's occurrence.
The possible impact in the event of such occurence.

Risks with a high probability and impact value are determined by multiplying both factors

Once a risk is identified, it is important to understand the risk.

## Scrum Processes

Product Backlog of prioritized requirements

Product owner for prioritizing requirements

Now the question is how do u get this work done.

Scrum Processes address the specific activities and flow of a Scrum project. In total, there are 19 processes which are grouped into 5 phases.

5 Phases describe each process in detail including the associated input, tools and output. Input, tools and output are designated as mandatory while others are designated as optional with desicion to include any optional input, tool or an output depends on a particular project, organization or industry. Input and output are denoted mandantory or important to the successful implemtation of Scrum in any organization.

![processes](/04-Processes.JPG)

### Initiate

#### Create project vision:

In this process, the project business case is reviewed to create Project Vision Statement that will service inspiration and provide focus for the entire project.

Product Owner is indentified in his process

#### Indentify Scrum Master ans Stakeholder

This is the second process during which the Scrum master is identified using specific selection criteria

#### Form Scrum Team

Scrum team members are identified

Normally the product owner is responsible for selecting team members, often does so in collaboration with the Scrum Master.

#### Develop Epic(s)

The fourth process

In this process, Project Vision Statement serves as the basis for developing Epic

User Group Meetings may be held to develop Epic(s)

#### Create a Prioritized Product Backlog

Epic(s) and Unrefined User Stories refined and elaborated and prioritized to create a Prioritized Product Backlog

The Done Criteria is also established

#### Conduct Release Planning

The Scrum Core Team reviews the User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog to develop a Release Planning Schedule which is essentially a phase deployment schedule that can be shared with project stakeholders.

#### Planning and estimate

##### Create User Stories

First process

Create user stories and their related User Story Acceptance Criteria are created

Usually written by the Product Owner

Designed to ensure that the customer's requirements are clearly depicted and understood.

Involves Scrum Team members creating the User Stories.

User stories are incorporated in the Prioritized Product Backlog

MANDATORY - INPUT, TOOLS AND OUTPUT

Estimate User Stories, Commit User Stories and Identify Tasks Processes

Mandatory inputs are :

Scrum Core Team

User Stories

People: Move the project from idea to reality

Form Scrum Team: In cross-functional teams. Potentially shippable deliverables at the end of each Sprint

Scrum can be used for managing projects of all sizes. Scrum works for most projects in team sizes. Large utilizes multiple Scrum teams.

Scrum is focused on working sofware over comprehensive documentation and that focus on Product increments

Collaboration: Customers, business team, project team. To minimize risk, achieve satisfaction. "What will be done" from "What needs to be done"

Risk Management: Continuous. Product Owner, Scrum Team and Scrum Master determine best approach to handle identified risk

Traditional methods decide approach upfront. Risks are handle upfront even b4 many risks have been identified.

According to Scrum, Deliverables goes to Q&A as it is developed and testing is carried out. With customer value in mind.

Strict controls such as exception criteria and clear definition of done are in place to aviod deviation in the customer requirements.

Scrum believes Product development is a shared value-creation process that needs all the stakeholders working and interacting together to deliver the greatest value. Command and control is the rule of the day in traditional methods.

Value of Customer: Scrum is designed for customer involvement. In traditional methods involvement is limited and can very depending on project.

Scrum is an innovative framework for manageing any type of project.
